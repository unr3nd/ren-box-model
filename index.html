        <h1>Im going to demonstrate the box model on here.</h1>
        <p>The box model consist of having the margin, border, and padding.
        <br> It starts with the margin on the outside, the then border, then the padding. 
        <br> That is from outer to inner. 
        <p>Pretty interesting stuff and cool to finally get to implement this material into my first project.</p>
        <p>By adding these features (CSS and html) together it makes a website much more appealing to view and makes the user experience more fun.</p>
